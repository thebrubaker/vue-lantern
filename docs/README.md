# Introduction

Lantern is an application structure targeted towards large, serious projects and assumes you are somewhat familiar with Webpack, VueLoader and building Single Page Applications.

## Quickstart

To use this template, scaffold a project with [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init thebrubaker/vue-lantern
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
